# Exoplanet---Classification
# Exoplanet Classification Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to classify exoplanets based on data from telescopes. Our goal is to utilize machine learning algorithms to predict the class of each observed celestial body. The data is obtained from the NASA Exoplanet Archive, including light curve data from the Kepler and TESS missions.
